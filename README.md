I used React JS for this assignment.
Intellij hasn't commited the node_modules directory in which is code for a bunch of dependencies.
The dependencies are listed in "package.json" and i believe they'll be downloaded for you, but i'm not sure.
Since React JS requires their "npm ..." commands, i think you'll need to download at least those to make this thing all work, or maybe it'll be downloaded for you as well.
